        <div id="aboutMeParagraphs">
            <p class="aboutMeParagraph">Hello, I'm Caleb Lanphere, a sophomore computer science at St. Bonaventure University in New York.
            I have been self-teaching myself programming on and off since I was twelve. Since starting university,
            I have drastically improved my skills and found the focus I want to spend the rest of my life
            working towards.</p>
            <p class="aboutMeParagraph">From middle through High School, I had big dreams, but did not have the skills to back up such
            adventures. I started but failed to finished multiple projects throughout 2018-2024, with two being
            completed and released. When starting my bachelors program, I gained enough skills to produce complete
            programs and released my first, from scratch, instant messenger using Java titled TextMe</p>
            <p id="finalAboutMeParagraph">I am thriving with the structured learning and I plan on releasing more programs throughout my time
            at St. Bonaventure and throughout the rest of my career.</p>

                <h3>User Experience Design | CS-257</h3>
                <p>Course Description: This course will expose the student to a wide variety of human-computer interaction material to enable them to understand and design positive user experiences with technology. Students will study the theory of user interface/experience design in class and will put that theory into practice through laboratory exercises and teamwork. Ways to learn from users will be covered, as well as design methods including prototyping, heuristics, and best practices. Broader design topics related to current computing trends will also be discussed from a human-centered perspective.</p>

                <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms | CS-132</h3>
                <p>Course Description: This is the second course in the computer science major sequence. The course utilizes the object- oriented design approach to building applications, which emphasizes the creation and utilization of reusable software tools. Students are introduced to data structures that are commonly encountered in building software applications and to the analysis of the efficiency of algorithms used to solve problems. The programming language Java is used to implement software designs.</p>
